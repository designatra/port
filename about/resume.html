        <h2>Atra [at*ra] — black. Latin.</h2>
        Black, in terms of pigment, is a combination of all colors. This represents my versatility in a numerous amount of assets that complement design. I started in art, then continued into design, with a knowledge of 3D programs, Flash, HTML, Print, Photography, etc. ATRA is also an acronym  for "Aspire To Retain Aesthetics." 
        Originating with an art background, I have always pursued to keep my design as appealing as possible. </li>
